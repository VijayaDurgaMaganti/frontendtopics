        <p><b><i>MS Dhoni added another feather to his cap in 2021 edition of the league as CSK won their fourth
                    title.
                    Ahead of the 2022 edition of the league, MS Dhoni was one of the four retained players by the
                    franchise and he was retained for a sum of INR 12 crore.
                    A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his
                    own.
                    The calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain accounts for a
                    lethal
                    combination on the cricketing field and the glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK
                    are
                    a testimony to his extraordinary leadership skills.</b></i><br />
            <i>He was the face of Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to
                two titles (2010 & 2011) and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player to be drafted
                by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the league. And, he once again became the first
                player to be retained by CSK ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league had
                a fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the Chennai
                Super Kings.
                The 2019 edition of the league too saw the CSK reach the finals of the tournament under
                MS Dhoni’s leadership.</i><br />
            While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots on a 16-year illustrious career for Team India,
            he was seen donning the CSK colours once again in 2020.

        <p><b><i>Captain Marvellous. Rohit Sharma has etched his name as the most successful captain in the IPL with
                    five trophies, the most by anyone in the tournament.
                    He has cracked the code and made MI the most consistent team.
                    A prolific run-getter, the Hitman is one of the most naturally gifted batsmen in the world and
                    has
                    been enjoying a tremendous run with the bat.
                    When it comes to the shorter format, there are few who can match his striking abilities.
                    Rohit proved why he is regarded as a special talent when he became the first batsman to strike
                    two
                    double centuries in the ODIs and he now has three.
                    He was one of the most consistent Deccan Chargers batsmen in the first three seasons of the IPL
                    and
                    was instrumental in his former franchise winning the crown in 2009 However, since 2011, Rohit
                    has
                    been an integral part of the Mumbai Indians guiding their batting line-up. He took over the
                    team’s
                    captaincy a couple of games into the 2013 season and led MI to their maiden IPL title.
                    In the same year, MI also completed a grand double when they clinched the Champions League T20
                    title. His captaincy was put to test in the 2015 season after the team won just one of their
                    first
                    six games and were struggling to stay afloat. Mumbai Indians then staged a remarkable turnaround
                    and
                    lifted the Trophy for the second time with a convincing win in the final.
                    Rohit, who made a half-century, was named the Player of the Match. The legacy of Hitman expanded
                    further on, after powering Mumbai Indians to title victories in the 2017 and 2019 seasons, both
                    being last ball thrillers.
                    Rohit led the Mumbai Indians to a successful campaign in the 2020 season, which was their second
                    consecutive title.
                    MI did not qualify for playoffs in the 14th season and will be raring to go this time.
                    He now returns as Team India’s full-time captain in all three formats of the game.</b></i><br />

            <i>Rohit was subsequently picked for the ODI team on a selection whim after his burst of vital
                performances
                in the World T20 and his impressive Ranji Trophy record.
                He made an impression in the CB series Down Under, playing some crucial cameos against stalwarts
                like
                Brett Lee and Stuart Clark, and a more-than-competent Sri Lankan attack.
                These inspired away performances in the World T20 and the CB series caught the eye of the selectors,
                and warranted him an extended run with the limited-overs side.</i><br />

                    man as
                    the team looks to set the ball rolling and make their mark in their maiden IPL season.
                    LSG picked KL Rahul one of the finest batters of the modern era to the board via draft and made
                    him
                    their captain.
                    While Rahul, who was earlier leading Punjab Kings, will have a new set of players at his
                    disposal,
                    he will be out to lead from the front and bring the best out of his new teammates.
                    KL Rahul has over 3200 IPL runs to his name and his run-tally from the last four seasons (recent
                    first) read: 626, 670, 593 and 659.

                    an Indian batsman in the IPL.
                    He has been a pillar for the Indian team across formats and it will not be any different when he
                    sets foot on the field for LSG</b></i><br />

            <i>KL Rahul has played for four IPL teams since he made his debut in 2013. His first season was for
                Royal
                Challengers Bangalore (RCB) after which he was part of Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2014 and 2015.
                He rejoined RCB in 2016, missed IPL 2017 because of injury, and then represented Punjab Kings (PBKS,
                previously known as Kings XI Punjab or KXIP) from 2018 to 2021.
                Rahul moved to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in IPL 2022.
                A versatile batter who started in the middle order before moving to the top,
                Rahul also keeps wicket in the IPL, and has emerged as one of the league's most consistent
                run-scorers,
                with more than 590 runs in each season from 2018 to 2022.</i><br />
